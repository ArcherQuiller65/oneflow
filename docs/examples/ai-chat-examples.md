## üí° Tips for Effective Prompts

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: "Make image brighter" vs "Increase brightness by 20%"
2. **Include Context**: "Using the existing LoadImage node..."
3. **Specify Output**: "...and save the result"
4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Split multi-step processes

### Common Patterns

- **"Load [type] and [action]"**: Basic processing workflows
- **"Connect to [node] and add [feature]"**: Extending existing workflows
- **"Create a workflow that [description]"**: Complete workflow generation
- **"Optimize this for [goal]"**: Performance and quality tuning

### Advanced Prompting

- **Conditional Logic**: "If the image is dark, brighten it, otherwise enhance contrast"
- **Parameter Specifications**: "Use 50 sampling steps with CFG scale 7.5"
- **Style References**: "In the style of [artist/technique]"
- **Quality Requirements**: "High quality suitable for printing"
